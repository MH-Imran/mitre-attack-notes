# T1027 – Obfuscated Files or Information

**Technique:** Obfuscated Files or Information  
**Tactic:** Defense Evasion

These are my personal notes on T1027. I tried to write them in a simple, “real-life” way so I actually remember what this technique is about.

## What This Technique Really Means

T1027 basically comes down to one idea:

**Attackers hide things.**

They don’t always use clean, readable scripts.  
Instead, they take their code and “mess it up” so it’s harder to understand.

Some ways they hide stuff:

- turning commands into long base64 strings  
- crushing JavaScript into one giant ugly line  
- hiding macros inside Office files  
- packing or encrypting malware  
- using weird variable names or random characters  
- breaking code into tiny pieces that reassemble later  

The goal is simple:  
**make the bad stuff less obvious.**

## Why Attackers Do This

If the command or file looks normal (or just confusing), then:

- antivirus might ignore it  
- basic detection rules won’t match it  
- analysts won’t understand it right away  

Obfuscation gives attackers extra time — even a few minutes can matter.

## Why This Matters for SOC Analysts

Even if I can’t “read” the script, the behavior still tells the truth.

Signs something is off:

- PowerShell commands filled with base64  
- scripts that look completely unreadable  
- file names that look randomly generated  
- long strings that don’t look like normal code  
- encoded payloads inside HTTP requests  
- strange activity right after a script runs  

As a SOC analyst, I don’t need to fully decode the script every time.  
I just need to notice that **something doesn’t look normal**.

## What Clicked for Me

- Obfuscation doesn’t make the attack invisible — it just makes it look confusing.  
- The logs still show important clues (processes, file paths, network connections).  
- This technique often works together with:
  - T1059 (Command and Scripting)
  - T1204 (User Execution)
  - T1110 (Brute Force → coming next)
- If I see a long encoded string in PowerShell, it’s basically a red flag by itself.

Basically:  
**When the code looks weird, the behavior usually looks suspicious too.**

## What I Want to Try Later in My Home Lab

Once Security Onion / Sysmon are ready, I want to test:

- running a base64 PowerShell command  
- watching how it appears in logs  
- decoding the string to see what it really was  
- trying a packed script to see how detection tools react  
- writing a simple detection rule for “encoded PowerShell”  

These small experiments will help me understand how obfuscation appears in real logs — and how defenders detect it.
