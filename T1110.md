# T1110 – Brute Force

This is my own summary of T1110, written in a simple way so I can remember what matters when looking for brute force activity in logs.

## What T1110 Is

Brute force is when an attacker tries to guess passwords repeatedly until one works. This can be done quickly with tools or slowly to avoid detection. It’s one of the most common real-world attack techniques because it doesn’t require malware — just weak or reused passwords.

## Types of Brute Force I Learned About

- **Password Spraying** – same password, many accounts  
- **Dictionary Attack** – trying a list of common passwords  
- **Credential Stuffing** – using leaked passwords from other websites  
- **Traditional Brute Force** – trying many combinations for one account  

These show up differently in logs, but the patterns start becoming obvious.

## What To Look For in Logs

- Many failed login attempts in a short time  
- Repeated failures from the same IP  
- Attempts for accounts that don’t usually log in  
- Successful login after a long series of failures  
- Logins from unusual locations or odd times  
- Multiple machines reporting login failures at once  

Even without a SIEM, these signs are easy to see once you know where to look.

## Why This Matters in a SOC Environment

- Brute force is one of the top alerts in real SOC work.  
- Weak or reused passwords make it extremely effective.  
- A defender needs to instantly distinguish “user forgot password” vs “attack in progress.”  
- This technique connects directly to credential theft, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.

## My Takeaways

- Brute force is simple but still dangerous because humans tend to reuse passwords.  
- Log patterns tell the whole story — failed attempts, timing, source IPs, and login success.  
- Practicing this in my lab will help me later when I analyze authentication logs in Security Onion or a SIEM.
