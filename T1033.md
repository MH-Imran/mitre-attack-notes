# T1033 – System Owner / User Discovery

I spent some time today going through MITRE technique T1033, and honestly this one was pretty straightforward. It’s basically about how an attacker, after getting into a machine, tries to figure out “who am I here?” and “what other users exist?”. Nothing fancy, but it makes sense — if you land on a system, you’d want to know your level of access before doing anything else.

I tested a few of the common commands on Windows first: `whoami`, `net user`, `query user`, and checking the administrators group. It surprised me how quickly these commands give away useful info. Within a few seconds, you can tell if the current account is normal or has admin rights. I can clearly see why attackers love using these simple commands. They blend in easily and reveal a lot.

On the Linux side, it was almost the same idea, just different commands: `whoami`, `id`, `groups`, and looking at `/etc/passwd`. Again, nothing complicated but it shows all the user accounts and what groups they belong to. I have used some of these commands before without really thinking about them  but now I am starting to understand the “why” behind them.

The interesting part is how all of this looks completely normal in logs. These commands don’t scream “attack” at all. They look like everyday admin activity. But in the wrong situation — like after a weird login or from a strange account — they can mean something is going on. That’s something I need to pay more attention to when I start analyzing logs seriously.

My takeaway from T1033 is pretty simple: attackers don’t always start with big, noisy actions. Sometimes it’s tiny things like checking who they are or what users exist. Understanding these small steps helps me think better from both sides — the attacker side and the defender side.

I’ll keep adding notes like this as I go through more techniques.
