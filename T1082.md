# T1082 – System Information Discovery

Today I spent time learning about MITRE ATT&CK technique T1082.  
It focuses on something very simple but extremely important: finding out what system an attacker has landed on after gaining access.  
Before doing anything loud or risky, they first “look around.”

This part felt very realistic because the commands used are the same ones any admin (or even I) would use to check basic system info.

## What T1082 actually means (in my own words)

After an attacker gets into a machine, they don’t immediately start attacking things.  
First, they figure out:

- What operating system it is  
- What version it’s running  
- What hardware it has  
- Whether it’s a VM or a real server  
- How much RAM or disk space is available  
- What the hostname is  

Basically, they want to understand the environment so they can choose the right exploit or next step.

It’s harmless-looking behavior, but very important in the attack chain.
